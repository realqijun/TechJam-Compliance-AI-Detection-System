0REQUIRED,Curfew login blocker with ASL and GH for Utah minors,REQUIRED,0.98,"The Utah Social Media Regulation Act explicitly defines and mandates requirements for 'Utah minor account holders.' Section 13-71-101 (13) from UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_8.txt defines a 'Utah minor account holder' as a 'Utah account holder who is a minor.' Furthermore, Section 13-71-101 (12) defines a 'Utah account holder' as 'a person who is a Utah resident and an account holder.' Provisions such as Section 13-71-202 (1)(a) and (2)(a) from UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt, and Section 13-71-201 (1) from UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_9.txt, impose specific obligations (e.g., default privacy settings, parental consent, supervisory tools, age assurance) that apply solely to these 'Utah minor account holders.' Therefore, to correctly identify and apply these regulations, geo-specific compliance logic is required to determine if an account holder is a resident of Utah.",UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_9.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_8.txt,Utah,
1REQUIRED,PF default toggle with NR enforcement for California teens,REQUIRED,1.00,"The definition of 'minor' in Section 27000.5(d) explicitly states 'an individual under 18 years of age who is located in the State of California.' This necessitates geo-specific logic to identify the target population for the protections and requirements of this chapter, such as the default settings for minors outlined in Section 27002(b). The feature's description 'for users under 18 located in California' directly aligns with this geo-specific definition.",CA_SB976_Provision_27000.5; CA_SB976_Provision_27002,California,
2REQUIRED,Child abuse content scanner using T5 and CDS triggers,REQUIRED,0.95,"The feature explicitly states it is 'In line with the US federal law requiring providers to report child sexual abuse content to NCMEC.' The provided US regulations (US_2258A_Provision_a.txt) detail this specific reporting obligation to NCMEC. Conversely, the provided EU regulations (EU_DSA_Article_16.txt and EU_DSA_Article_22.txt) establish a distinct framework for handling illegal content, including general notice-and-action mechanisms and a system for 'trusted flaggers' overseen by Digital Services Coordinators, with no mention of NCMEC. Therefore, if this feature were to operate in both the US and EU, it would require geo-specific compliance logic to adhere to the differing legal requirements and reporting mechanisms of each region. The feature's own description, 'Regional thresholds are governed by LCP parameters in the backend,' acknowledges the need for such regional adaptation.",US_2258A_Provision_a.txt; EU_DSA_Article_16.txt; EU_DSA_Article_22.txt,US; EU,
3REQUIRED,Content visibility lock with NSP for EU DSA,REQUIRED,0.95,"The feature explicitly states that ""enforcement is restricted to the EU region only."" This directly aligns with EU_DSA_Article_9.txt, which mandates that orders to remove or disable access to specific illegal content ""must be territorially limited (only as far as needed to meet the objective)."" The article further requires providers to inform the affected user about the ""territorial scope"" of such orders. Therefore, geo-specific compliance logic is required to implement and communicate these territorial limitations.",EU_DSA_Article_9.txt,EU,
4REQUIRED,Jellybean-based parental notifications for Florida regulation,REQUIRED,1.00,"The feature explicitly states its purpose is 'To support Florida's Online Protections for Minors law'. All provided regulations are specific to Florida. Specifically, FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_7.txt defines the jurisdiction of the courts of this state (Florida) for social media platforms based on their activities 'within this state' concerning minor account holders. This directly mandates geo-specific compliance logic to apply the regulations only to users or activities within Florida.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_7.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_3a.txt,Florida,
5REQUIRED,Unified retention control via DRT & CDS,REQUIRED,0.95,"The feature describes a 'unified retention control' and 'automatic log deletion across all regions' with 'Spanner logic ensures all platform modules comply uniformly.' However, the provided regulations demonstrate geo-specific requirements for data retention and deletion that necessitate distinct logic based on location. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Florida (FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2b.txt):** Mandates the permanent deletion of all personal information for terminated accounts of 'account holders' younger than 14 years of age, who are defined as 'residents' of Florida. This is a specific deletion requirement tied to a geographical location.\n2.  **United States Federal (US_2258A_Provision_h.txt):** Requires the preservation of reported content related to child sexual exploitation for 1 year. This is a retention requirement that applies federally across the United States, potentially conflicting with or overriding general deletion policies for specific types of data.\n3.  **California (CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt):** Requires operators to provide parental controls that limit access or notifications during specific hours based on the 'user’s local time zone' and for 'minor' users. While not directly a data retention rule, it implies the need for geo-specific identification (local time zone) to apply these controls, which could impact how user activity logs are managed or retained in relation to these restrictions.\n\nTherefore, a single, uniform retention policy across all regions would not adequately address these distinct, geographically-bound obligations for data deletion and preservation.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2b.txt; US_2258A_Provision_h.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt,Florida; United States; California,
6REQUIRED,NSP auto-flagging,REQUIRED,0.95,"Geo-specific compliance logic is required due to several regulations. In the US, if the 'NSP auto-flagging' feature detects content that constitutes an 'apparent violation' of child pornography laws (e.g., under US_2258A_Provision_a.txt), there is a mandatory duty to report to the CyberTipline, which is a US-specific entity. This also triggers US-specific content preservation requirements (US_2258A_Provision_h.txt). For EU users, if the auto-flagging leads to content restrictions ('Softblock', 'Redline alert'), the provider must issue a clear and specific statement of reasons to the affected user, as mandated by EU_DSA_Article_17.txt. Furthermore, if the auto-flagging system collects or uses data from Utah minor account holders, it must comply with the data confidentiality provisions of UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt, which prohibits certain uses of minor's data (e.g., for advertising or content recommendation). These distinct regional requirements necessitate geo-specific logic to ensure compliance.",US_2258A_Provision_a.txt; US_2258A_Provision_h.txt; EU_DSA_Article_17.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt,US; EU; Utah,
7REQUIRED,T5 tagging for sensitive reports,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature, which involves 'T5 tagging for sensitive reports' and subsequent 'escalation' of 'high-risk information,' cannot operate universally without geo-specific compliance logic due to several regulations. US federal law (US_2258A_Provision_a.txt) mandates a duty to report specific content (e.g., child pornography) to the CyberTipline of NCMEC 'as soon as reasonably possible' and also imposes specific preservation duties (US_2258A_Provision_h.txt). These are explicit, mandatory, and geo-specific actions that the 'T5 tagging' and 'escalation' system must be designed to trigger for content originating or accessible within the United States. Furthermore, the EU's Digital Services Act (EU_DSA_Article_24.txt, EU_DSA_Article_35.txt) requires specific transparency reporting and risk mitigation measures for content moderation, particularly concerning illegal content and child protection, which would necessitate geo-specific data collection and categorization for EU operations. Utah's Social Media Regulation Act (UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt) also imposes geo-specific restrictions on data collection and use for minor account holders, which would impact how 'high-risk information' involving minors is handled during escalation. Florida's HB3 (FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Context.txt, FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_6.txt) also establishes jurisdiction and requirements for entities distributing material harmful to minors, implying a need for geo-specific consideration in content handling.",US_2258A; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3; EU_DSA; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct,US; EU; Florida; Utah,
8REQUIRED,Underage protection via Snowcap trigger,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature 'Underage protection via Snowcap trigger' is designed to protect underage users. Multiple provided regulations explicitly require geo-specific logic to apply protections, restrictions, and consent mechanisms for minors based on their location. For instance, California's SB976 mandates specific notification restrictions based on a minor's local time zone and location within California. Utah's Social Media Regulation Act and Florida's CS_CS_HB_3 also define specific requirements for 'Utah minor account holders' and minors 'within this state' respectively, including data handling, default privacy settings, and account creation rules. The EU DSA Article 28 also requires specific measures for minors within the EU, such as prohibiting targeted ads based on profiling. Therefore, to comply with these varied regional laws, the platform must implement geo-specific logic to identify the user's location and apply the appropriate regional underage protection rules.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_7.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_3a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; EU_DSA_Article_28.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt,Florida; EU; California; Utah,
9,Universal PF deactivation on guest mode,NOT_REQUIRED,0.90,"The provided regulations from Florida, California, and Utah primarily focus on requirements for 'account holders,' 'minor users,' or 'minor account holders,' often involving age verification, parental consent, and specific controls for their accounts. The regulations do not explicitly mandate the universal deactivation of features (referred to as 'PF' in the feature description, which is not defined in the regulations but assumed to relate to algorithmic feeds or addictive features) for 'all uses browsing in guest mode.' While deactivating such features in guest mode might align with the spirit of protecting minors, it is not a direct requirement for all users in guest mode based on the provided text.",,,
10REQUIRED,Story resharing with content expiry,REQUIRED,0.98,"The 'Story resharing with content expiry' feature, which involves content display, logging of resharing attempts, and storage of activity, triggers several geo-specific compliance requirements. The 48-hour auto-expiry directly conflicts with the 1-year preservation requirement for reported child sexual exploitation (CSA) material and related data in the United States. Additionally, the logging and storage of activity are considered personal information subject to permanent deletion for terminated minor accounts in Florida. In California and Utah, if reshared stories are part of an 'addictive feed' or 'algorithmically curated social media service' with 'engagement driven design elements', geo-specific parental consent and control mechanisms for minors would be required. The EU's Digital Services Act also imposes requirements for content removal orders and internal complaint systems that would apply to this feature's content and associated data.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2b.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; context.txt; US_2258A_Provision_h.txt; US_2258A_Provision_a.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_5.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_8.txt; EU_DSA_Article_5.txt; EU_DSA_Article_20.txt,US; EU; Florida; California; Utah,
11REQUIRED,Leaderboard system for weekly creators,REQUIRED,0.95,"The 'Leaderboard system for weekly creators' feature, which tracks and displays 'points and rankings' using 'internal analytics', directly implicates regulations concerning minors and the display of user metrics across multiple jurisdictions. For California, the feature would likely fall under 'addictive internet-based service or application' and require parental controls to limit a minor's ability to view 'likes or other forms of feedback' (which points and rankings represent) by default, and parental consent for sending notifications to minors during specific hours. For Utah, if the leaderboard uses a minor's data for 'recommending content' or 'advertising' (e.g., promoting top creators), it would be prohibited. For Florida, displaying 'personal interactive metrics' (which points and rankings derived from engagement would be) contributes to a platform's classification as a 'social media platform', triggering a prohibition on minors under 16 from becoming account holders. These requirements necessitate geo-specific compliance logic to manage the feature's functionality based on user location and age.",CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt,CA; UT; FL,
12REQUIRED,Mood-based PF enhancements,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature 'Mood-based PF enhancements' adjusts recommendations based on inferred mood signals from emoji usage, which constitutes algorithmic content selection based on user data. This directly triggers geo-specific compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions:\n\n1.  **California (CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt & context.txt):** If the platform is an 'addictive internet-based service or application' and the feature is part of an 'addictive feed' (as defined in context.txt, where recommendations are based on user information), then for minors in California, parents must be able to 'Require that the default feed provided to the child... be one in which pieces of media are not recommended, selected, or prioritized for display based on information provided by the user, or otherwise associated with the user or the user’s device, other than the user’s age or status as a minor' (CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt (b)(4)). This explicitly requires geo-specific logic to offer a non-personalized feed option for minors, meaning mood-based recommendations would need to be disabled or not applied in that default feed.\n\n2.  **European Union (EU_DSA_Article_27.txt & EU_DSA_Article_38.txt):** For all platforms using recommender systems, Article 27 requires clear explanations in terms and conditions about the main parameters used by the system (e.g., inferred mood signals) and options for users to modify or influence those parameters. For Very Large Online Platforms (VLOPs) and Very Large Online Search Engines (VLOSEs), Article 38 mandates providing at least one recommender system option not based on profiling (which 'inferred mood signals' would be). These are direct geo-specific requirements for the EU.\n\n3.  **Utah (UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_5.txt):** To qualify for an affirmative defense, a social media company must 'disable engagement driven design elements for a Utah minor account holder's account' and 'require the parent or legal guardian of the minor to consent to a Utah minor account holder's use of the algorithmically curated social media service' (UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_5.txt (1)(c) and (1)(d)). Mood-based recommendations are an engagement-driven design element or part of an algorithmically curated service, thus requiring geo-specific logic for minors in Utah.\n\n4.  **Florida (FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt & FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt):** If the platform meets the definition of a 'social media platform' (which includes employing algorithms that analyze user data to select content), Florida law prohibits minors younger than 14 years of age from becoming account holders (FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt). This means the mood-based recommendation feature cannot be applied to users under 14 in Florida, necessitating age verification and geo-specific logic.",CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; context.txt; EU_DSA_Article_27.txt; EU_DSA_Article_38.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_5.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt,US-CA; EU; US-UT; US-FL,
13REQUIRED,New user rewards via NR profile suggestions,REQUIRED,0.95,"The feature 'New user rewards via NR profile suggestions' occurs during user onboarding. Several regulations mandate geo-specific age verification and parental consent for minors to create accounts or access certain features, which directly impacts who can see this onboarding feature and under what conditions. Additionally, EU regulations require specific options and transparency for recommender systems, which would apply to 'NR-curated profiles' for users in the EU.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_9.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; EU_DSA_Article_38.txt; EU_DSA_Article_27.txt,Florida; Utah; California; EU,
14NEEDS REVIEW,Creator fund payout tracking in CDS,UNCERTAIN,0.80,"The provided regulations (EU_DSA_Article_39, EU_DSA_Article_17, EU_DSA_Article_24, EU_DSA_Article_72, EU_DSA_Article_46) primarily focus on ad transparency, content moderation, transparency reporting, and Commission oversight. While some articles mention geo-specific data (e.g., 'Member State breakdown' for ad reach in Article 39, 'average monthly active recipients in the EU' for reporting in Article 24), these are tied to specific contexts like public ad repositories or platform size determination, not internal 'creator fund payout tracking' or 'anomaly detection in creator payouts'. The regulations do not contain specific provisions or requirements for geo-specific compliance logic related to the internal tracking of creator monetization events or anomaly detection for payouts. The term 'DRT rules' is also not defined within the provided text.",,,
15REQUIRED,Trial run of video replies in EU,REQUIRED,0.90,"The feature is explicitly rolled out to 'users in EEA only'. The provided regulations, specifically EU_DSA_Article_15.txt and EU_DSA_Article_24.txt, mandate transparency reporting requirements that are geo-specific to the EU. For instance, Article 24 requires platforms to publish 'the average monthly active recipients in the EU' and provide this information to EU authorities. Article 15 requires reporting on content moderation activities, including orders from authorities (specifying 'issuing Member State'), notices, and complaints, all of which would apply to content generated by this feature within the EU. To comply with these EU-specific reporting obligations, the platform must implement geo-specific logic to identify and track the activities of its EU/EEA user base related to this feature.",EU_DSA_Article_15.txt; EU_DSA_Article_24.txt,EU; EEA,
16NEEDS REVIEW,Canada-first PF variant test,UNCERTAIN,1.00,"The feature specifies a 'Canada-first PF variant test' in 'CA'. None of the provided regulations are applicable to Canada. The regulations provided pertain to Florida, the EU, California, Utah, and general US federal law regarding child sexual exploitation material. Therefore, the provided regulations do not contain enough information to determine if geo-specific compliance logic is required for this feature in Canada.",,Canada,
17REQUIRED,Chat UI overhaul,REQUIRED,0.95,"The 'Chat UI overhaul' feature, especially when combined with 'collect usage metrics' and 'location targeting', triggers compliance requirements in California and Florida (a U.S. state). In California, regulations like CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt mandate specific controls for minors on 'addictive internet-based services or applications', including restrictions on sending notifications during certain hours and providing parental control mechanisms for features like notifications, access limits, and privacy settings. A chat UI overhaul could directly impact how notifications are sent or how content is displayed within an 'addictive feed'. Additionally, CA_SB976_Provision_27005.txt requires annual public disclosure of minor users and parental consent. In Florida, FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt defines 'social media platform' and lists 'addictive features' such as 'Push notifications' and 'Displays personal interactive metrics'. If the chat UI overhaul incorporates or enhances these features, and the platform meets the definition of a 'social media platform' (e.g., based on minor user engagement and algorithmic content selection), then geo-specific compliance logic is required for Florida residents. The regulations for Brazil (BR) and Indonesia (ID) were not provided, making compliance status for those regions uncertain based solely on the given information. The federal US regulations (US_2258A) regarding CSA reporting do not require monitoring, so the feature itself does not introduce new compliance obligations under those specific provisions.",CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27005.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt,CA; US; BR; ID,
18REQUIRED,Regional trial of autoplay behavior,REQUIRED,0.95,"The feature 'Enable video autoplay' directly relates to 'Auto-play video' which is defined as an 'addictive feature' for a 'social media platform' under Florida regulations (FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Glossary.txt). These regulations impose restrictions on minors becoming account holders based on their residency in Florida, requiring geo-specific identification. Similarly, California regulations (context.txt, CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt) imply that auto-played video content can contribute to an 'addictive feed' for an 'addictive internet-based service or application'. For such services, operators must provide parental controls for 'minors' located in California. Since the feature is a 'Regional trial of autoplay behavior' for 'users in US', and both Florida and California (states within the US) have specific regulations tied to user location and autoplay video for minors, geo-specific compliance logic is required to adhere to these state-specific requirements.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3; CA_SB976,Florida; California,
19,South Korea dark theme A/B experiment,NOT_REQUIRED,0.90,"The provided regulations do not contain any specific requirements or prohibitions regarding 'dark theme' features, A/B testing, or general accessibility mandates that are geo-specific to South Korea. While some EU regulations (EU_DSA_Article_47.txt) discuss promoting voluntary accessibility codes of conduct and others (EU_DSA_Article_25.txt, EU_DSA_Article_35.txt) mention interface design in the context of preventing manipulation or mitigating systemic risks, these are specific to the EU and do not mandate a dark theme or apply to South Korea. Regulations from California, Utah, and Florida, and US federal regulations are also not applicable to this feature or region.",,,
20REQUIRED,Age-specific notification controls with ASL,REQUIRED,0.95,"The California 'Protecting Our Kids from Social Media Addiction Act' (CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt) explicitly makes it unlawful for operators of addictive internet-based services or applications to send notifications to minors during specific hours (12 a.m. to 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekdays from September through May, in the user’s local time zone) without verifiable parental consent. It also mandates that operators provide a mechanism for verified parents to prevent or limit their child's access to or receipt of notifications during specific hours, with a default setting to limit access between 12 a.m. and 6 a.m. in the user's local time zone. The feature's description of 'throttle or suppress push alerts for minors' and 'notifications will be tailored by age' directly addresses these requirements. As the regulation applies to minors 'located in the State of California' (as defined in context.txt, Section 27000.5(d)) and specifies 'in the user’s local time zone', geo-specific logic is necessary to apply these controls only to users within California.",CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt,California,
21REQUIRED,Chat content restrictions via LCP,REQUIRED,0.90,"The 'Chat content restrictions via LCP' feature involves moderating user-generated content, which triggers specific compliance requirements in multiple jurisdictions. In the USA, if the feature detects child sexual abuse material (CSAM), it creates a mandatory duty to report to the CyberTipline. In the EU, if content is restricted, the platform must provide clear statements of reasons to affected users and have policies for repeat offenders. In Florida, if the chat feature facilitates the distribution of 'material harmful to minors' by a 'commercial entity' on a platform with a 'substantial portion' of such material, age verification and prevention of access by minors are required.",US_2258A_Provision_a.txt; EU_DSA_Article_17.txt; EU_DSA_Article_23.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt,USA; EU; Florida,
22,Video upload limits for new users,NOT_REQUIRED,1.00,"The provided regulations do not contain any provisions that explicitly or implicitly require a social media platform to implement 'video upload limits for new users' based on 'BB patterns' for general 'platform safety'. While some regulations address content moderation (e.g., EU DSA), reporting of illegal content (e.g., US_2258A), or restrictions for minors (e.g., Florida and Utah laws), none mandate this specific feature as a geo-specific compliance requirement for all new users.",,,
23REQUIRED,Flag escalation flow for sensitive comments,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature 'Flag escalation flow for sensitive comments' detects 'high-risk comment content.' Several provided regulations impose geo-specific requirements for handling such content. In the US, there is a mandatory duty to report child sexual exploitation material to NCMEC, a US-specific entity, and to include specific information like geographic location in reports. In Utah, the Social Media Regulation Act defines 'electronic communication harassment,' including the disclosure of a minor's personal identifying information, and establishes penalties and civil actions, requiring platforms to address such content according to Utah law. In the EU, the Digital Services Act mandates specific processes for handling 'illegal content,' such as giving priority to notices from 'trusted flaggers' and suspending users for frequently providing 'manifestly illegal content,' which are EU-specific mechanisms. These regulations necessitate geo-specific compliance logic for content detection, reporting, and moderation.",US_2258A_Provision_a.txt; US_2258A_Provision_b.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_1.txt; EU_DSA_Article_22.txt; EU_DSA_Article_23.txt; EU_DSA_Article_35.txt,US; Utah; EU,
24REQUIRED,User behavior scoring for policy gating,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature 'User behavior scoring for policy gating' involves analyzing user behavior and controlling access to tools, which directly relates to several geo-specific regulations concerning minors and algorithmic content. Florida, California, and Utah regulations define 'minor' and 'resident' geo-specifically and mandate age verification, parental consent, and restrictions on 'social media platforms' or 'addictive internet-based services' based on age and location. The EU DSA also requires measures for protecting children's rights, including age verification and parental controls. Therefore, the behavioral scoring and policy gating must incorporate geo-specific logic to comply with these varying requirements for identifying minors, applying default settings, enforcing access restrictions, and managing algorithmic content based on the user's location.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3; EU_DSA; CA_SB976; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct,Florida; EU; California; Utah,
25REQUIRED,Minor-safe chat expansion via Jellybean,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature, 'Minor-safe chat expansion via Jellybean,' which limits certain functions (e.g., media sharing) for users flagged as minors, directly aligns with regulations in Florida and Utah that impose geo-specific requirements for social media platforms concerning minors. Florida law mandates age-based restrictions for account contracts and age verification for access to material harmful to minors. Utah law provides an affirmative defense for social media companies that implement specific restrictions for 'Utah minor account holders,' including usage time limits, nighttime access restrictions, parental consent requirements, and disabling engagement-driven design elements. It also requires default private settings and parental supervisory tools for 'Utah minor account holders.' These regulations explicitly require different handling of minors based on their geographic location, thus necessitating geo-specific compliance logic for the described feature.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_3a.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_5.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt,Florida; Utah,
26REQUIRED,Friend suggestions with underage safeguards,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature involves 'friend suggestions' (a form of content recommendation) and 'underage safeguards' (excluding minors from adult pools). Multiple regulations across different geographies impose specific, differing requirements for minors, age verification, parental consent, and content recommendation systems. Florida law prohibits minors under certain ages from creating accounts or requires parental consent. California law mandates specific default settings for minors' feeds, including not recommending content based on user information other than age or minor status. Utah law requires age assurance and parental consent for minor accounts and prohibits collecting minor's data for content recommendations. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) requires platforms accessible to minors to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security, and mandates transparency and non-profiling options for recommender systems. These varied and specific requirements necessitate geo-specific compliance logic to correctly apply the relevant rules based on the user's location.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_3a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_9.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt; EU_DSA_Article_27.txt; EU_DSA_Article_28.txt; EU_DSA_Article_38.txt,Florida; California; Utah; EU,
27REQUIRED,Reaction GIFs with embedded filtering,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature 'Reaction GIFs with embedded filtering' involves filtering content deemed inappropriate for minor accounts and applying softblocks based on 'ASL-flagged profiles,' which directly relates to age-specific content moderation and protection for minors. Regulations from the EU (DSA Article 28) explicitly require platforms accessible to minors to implement appropriate measures for their safety and security. Utah's Social Media Regulation Act (Provisions 10, 5, and 11) mandates specific geo-specific requirements for 'Utah minor account holders,' including default privacy settings, parental consent for account changes, parental supervisory tools, and restrictions on data collection and engagement-driven design elements. Florida's regulations (HB 3 Provision 501.1736.7 and context.txt) establish jurisdiction over social media platforms allowing minors and define 'material harmful to minors,' implying a need for content moderation for minors within the state. These regulations collectively necessitate geo-specific compliance logic to apply the correct age-based restrictions and protections based on the user's location.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_7.txt; context.txt; EU_DSA_Article_28.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_5.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt,EU; Florida; Utah,
28REQUIRED,Longform posts with age-based moderation,REQUIRED,0.95,"The feature 'Longform posts with age-based moderation' directly involves handling content created by 'underage authors' and applying 'stricter moderation.' This necessitates geo-specific compliance logic due to regulations in Florida, the EU, and California. Florida regulations, such as FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt and FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt, prohibit minors under certain ages from entering into contracts to become account holders, which would prevent them from creating posts. FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt also requires age verification for access to material harmful to minors if the platform contains a substantial portion of such material. The EU's DSA Article 28 mandates 'appropriate, proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security for minors,' which stricter moderation for underage authors would fall under. Furthermore, DSA Article 34 requires VLOPs/VLOSEs to assess systemic risks related to 'child rights' and 'protection of minors.' California's CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt outlines specific parental controls and default settings for minors on 'addictive internet-based services or applications,' and CA_SB976_Provision_27005.txt requires annual disclosure of minor users. These regulations are explicitly geo-specific and require platforms to implement age-based logic to comply with varying requirements based on the user's location.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt; EU_DSA_Article_28.txt; EU_DSA_Article_34.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27002.txt; CA_SB976_Provision_27005.txt,FL; EU; CA,
29REQUIRED,Custom avatar system with identity checks,REQUIRED,0.98,"The feature involves 'Age detection' and blocking 'adult-themed assets from use by underage profiles.' Several regulations explicitly mandate age verification and content restrictions for minors, requiring geo-specific implementation. For instance, Florida law requires commercial entities distributing material harmful to minors to use age verification. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA) mandates appropriate measures for minor safety and explicitly mentions age verification for Very Large Online Platforms/Search Engines (VLOPs/VLOSEs). Utah's Social Media Regulation Act requires social media companies to use an approved age assurance system and obtain parental consent for minor account holders, and also imposes restrictions on data collection and advertising for minors. These regulations have distinct geo-specific requirements that necessitate tailored compliance logic.",FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1737_2.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_2a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_3a.txt; FLORIDA_CS_CS_HB_3_Provision_501_1736_4a.txt; EU_DSA_Article_28.txt; EU_DSA_Article_35.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_9.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_10.txt; UTAH_SocialMediaRegulationAct_Provision_11.txt,EU; Florida; Utah,
