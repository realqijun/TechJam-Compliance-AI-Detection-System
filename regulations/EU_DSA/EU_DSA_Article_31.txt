Statement:

Platforms enabling consumer-trader distance contracts must design their interfaces to allow traders to comply with EU rules on:

Pre-contractual information,

Product safety,

Product compliance.

Interfaces must let traders provide:

Economic operator’s contact details (as defined in Regulation (EU) 2019/1020).

Clear identification of products/services offered.

Trader identifiers (e.g., trademark, logo).

Labelling/marking information required under EU product safety and compliance law.

Platforms must:

Make best efforts to check traders provide required info before products/services go online.

After listing, make reasonable efforts to randomly verify, via official free databases, whether products/services have been flagged as illegal.

Context:

Ensures compliance is embedded in the platform’s design (“compliance by design”) rather than left to traders alone.

Protects consumers by ensuring key product and trader details are always available.

Supports product safety enforcement across the EU digital single market.

Shifts part of the responsibility for safe and transparent trading to online platforms themselves.
