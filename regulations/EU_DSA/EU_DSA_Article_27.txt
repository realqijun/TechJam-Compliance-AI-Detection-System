Statement:

Platforms using recommender systems must clearly explain in their terms and conditions:

The main parameters used by the system, in plain and understandable language.

The options available to users to modify or influence those parameters.

Main parameters must at least cover:

The key criteria determining suggested content.

The reasons for the importance of each parameter.

If multiple recommender options exist, platforms must provide users with a direct, easy-to-access functionality to:

Select their preferred option.

Modify it at any time from the section where content is prioritised.

Context:

Recommender systems = algorithms that prioritise or suggest content (e.g., news feeds, video recommendations).

Transparency ensures users understand why content is suggested and can influence recommendation settings.

User empowerment: provides choice and control over personalised content exposure.

Part of the DSAâ€™s wider goal of limiting opaque algorithmic influence and dark patterns.
