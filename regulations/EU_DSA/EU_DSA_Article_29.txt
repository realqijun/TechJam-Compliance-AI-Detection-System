Statement:

This Section does not apply to online platforms that allow consumers to conclude distance contracts with traders if the platform qualifies as a micro or small enterprise (Recommendation 2003/361/EC).

Exemption also applies for 12 months after losing micro/small status, unless the platform is a very large online platform (VLOP) under Article 33.

VLOPs must comply with these rules regardless of size.

Context:

Applies specifically to platforms enabling consumer-trader contracts online.

Provides regulatory relief for small businesses to avoid disproportionate burdens.

Ensures large-scale platforms (VLOPs) remain fully covered due to their systemic role in digital markets.

Builds on the EU’s definition of micro (<10 employees, turnover ≤ €2M) and small (<50 employees, turnover ≤ €10M) enterprises.
