Statement:

The Commission and the Board promote voluntary EU-level codes of conduct to support the proper application of the DSA.

Focus especially on tackling illegal content and systemic risks while respecting EU law (competition & data protection).

For systemic risks (Art. 34(1)) involving several VLOPs/VLOSEs, the Commission may invite:

concerned providers,

other relevant intermediary services,

authorities, civil society & stakeholders,

to help draw up codes with risk mitigation commitments and reporting frameworks.

Codes must include:

Clear objectives,

Key performance indicators (KPIs),

Regular reporting requirements, adapted for participant size/capacity.

Commission & Board will:

Assess if codes meet objectives,

Monitor and evaluate effectiveness,

Publish conclusions,

Encourage periodic review & adaptation.

If there is systematic non-compliance with codes, the Commission & Board may request signatories to take corrective action.

Context:

Provides a flexible, collaborative framework for handling new risks without immediate binding law.

Involves multi-stakeholder participation (platforms, authorities, civil society).

Uses KPIs & reporting to ensure accountability.

Functions as a “soft law” instrument: voluntary but influential, with Commission oversight.
