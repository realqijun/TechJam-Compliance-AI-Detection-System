Statement:

Platforms must ensure that every advertisement shown to users is clearly identifiable in real time, with at least:

A clear label that it is an advertisement (with prominent markings, possibly under Article 44 standards).

The name of the person/organisation on whose behalf the ad is shown.

The name of the person/organisation who paid for the ad (if different).

Meaningful, easily accessible info on the targeting parameters used to show the ad, and how users can adjust them.

Platforms must provide users a tool to declare if their content is commercial.

When declared, other users must see a clear real-time label that the content is a commercial communication.

Platforms are prohibited from showing ads based on profiling using special categories of personal data (Article 9(1) GDPR: e.g., race, religion, political beliefs, health, sexual orientation).

Context:

Reinforces advertising transparency and user awareness of why they see ads.

Extends responsibility to user-generated commercial content, requiring platforms to label it when declared.

Builds on GDPR protections by banning ad targeting that relies on sensitive personal data.

Part of the DSAâ€™s broader framework for trust, safety, and accountability in digital advertising.
