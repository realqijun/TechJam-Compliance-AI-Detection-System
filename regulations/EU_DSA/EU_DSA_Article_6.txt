Statement:

Hosting providers are not liable for user-stored content if:

They have no actual knowledge of illegal content/activity.

If they do gain knowledge, they remove or disable access quickly.

Exemptions don’t apply if:

The user acts under the provider’s authority/control.

An online platform misleads consumers into thinking content/products come from the platform itself.

Authorities can still order providers to stop or prevent infringements.

Context:

Applies to hosting services → storing info at user request.

Liability exemption linked to “notice and action” principle: providers must act when aware.

Online platforms facilitating distance contracts with consumers have stricter responsibility if they blur the line between trader and platform.

Member States’ judicial/administrative authorities retain enforcement powers.
