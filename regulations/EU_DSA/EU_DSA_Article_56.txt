Statement:

The Member State of a provider's main establishment holds primary powers for supervising and enforcing the Regulation, with certain exceptions where the Commission or other Member States can exercise powers.

Context:

Competence of Member States: The Member State where the provider’s main establishment is located has exclusive powers to enforce the Regulation, except for certain provisions that the Commission handles.

Commission's powers: The Commission has exclusive powers for enforcing Section 5 of Chapter III and also supervises providers of very large online platforms and search engines.

Enforcement when no Commission proceedings: If the Commission has not initiated proceedings for the same infringement, the Member State of the provider’s main establishment can enforce the Regulation.

Cooperation: Member States and the Commission must work together to supervise and enforce the Regulation.

Non-EU providers: If a provider has no establishment in the EU, the Member State where their legal representative is located, or the Commission, can enforce the Regulation.

Legal representative: If a provider fails to appoint a legal representative, the Commission and all Member States can enforce the Regulation, with Digital Services Coordinators notifying others to avoid duplicated proceedings for the same infringement.
