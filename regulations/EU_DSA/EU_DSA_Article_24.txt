Statement:

Platforms must add extra details to their annual transparency reports (Article 15), including:

Disputes (Article 21): number submitted, outcomes, median resolution times, share of implemented decisions.

Suspensions (Article 23): numbers, distinguishing between suspensions for:

Manifestly illegal content,

Manifestly unfounded notices,

Manifestly unfounded complaints.

Providers must also:

Publish, by 17 February 2023 and every 6 months thereafter, the average monthly active recipients in the EU (per platform/search engine).

Provide this information to the Digital Services Coordinator and the Commission upon request, including supporting data (but no personal data).

Submit decisions + statements of reasons (Article 17(1)) to the Commission for inclusion in a public machine-readable database.

The Commission may set templates for reporting format and content.

Context:

Builds on Article 15’s baseline transparency rules, adding extra duties for platforms.

Active recipients’ data helps determine whether a service meets the threshold for very large platforms/search engines (VLOPs/VLOSEs) under Article 33.

Ensures consistency and public accountability by requiring submission of moderation decisions to a Commission-managed database.

Allows cross-checking and monitoring by national and EU regulators.
