Statement:

Platforms accessible to minors must implement appropriate, proportionate measures to ensure a high level of privacy, safety, and security for minors.

Platforms must not show ads based on profiling (GDPR Article 4(4)) using personal data when they know with reasonable certainty that the user is a minor.

Platforms are not required to collect extra personal data just to determine if a user is a minor.

The Commission may issue guidelines to support compliance.

Context:

Strengthens child protection online, limiting profiling and targeted ads toward minors.

Balances protection with data minimisation principles â€” platforms cannot justify more intrusive data collection to check user age.

Reflects wider EU focus on child safety in digital spaces while preserving fundamental rights.

Commission guidelines (after consulting the Board) will help clarify best practices.
