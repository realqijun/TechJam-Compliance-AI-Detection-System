Statement:

VLOPs/VLOSEs must provide data access to:

Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) of establishment or the Commission, when requested, for monitoring DSA compliance.

Vetted researchers (via DSC) for research on systemic risks (Art. 34) and assessment of mitigation measures (Art. 35).

Providers must also explain their algorithmic systems (design, logic, functioning, testing) on request.

Data must be accessible through appropriate interfaces (e.g., APIs, databases).

Researchers can apply for “vetted researcher” status if they:

Are affiliated with a recognised research organisation,

Independent from commercial interests,

Disclose funding,

Ensure security, confidentiality, and GDPR compliance,

Show necessity and proportionality of data access,

Commit to making results publicly available free of charge,

Focus research on systemic risks under Art. 34.

Providers may request to amend access requests if:

They lack the data, or

Providing it risks security/confidentiality (e.g., trade secrets).

DSCs can terminate access if vetted researchers no longer meet conditions.

DSCs must share vetted researcher details with the Board.

Providers must allow general researcher access (not only vetted) to publicly available real-time data, if certain safeguards are met.

The Commission will issue delegated acts specifying:

Technical conditions for data sharing,

Permissible purposes of use,

Safeguards for confidentiality, trade secrets, and security.

Context:

Ensures regulators and researchers have oversight of VLOPs/VLOSEs to detect systemic risks like disinformation, manipulation, or algorithmic harms.

Balances transparency with safeguards: data access must protect privacy, security, and trade secrets.

Establishes a dual access channel: (1) regulators and Commission for compliance, (2) vetted researchers for systemic risk studies.

Provides flexibility via delegated acts, ensuring rules evolve with tech and risks.
