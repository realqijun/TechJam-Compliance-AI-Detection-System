Statement:

The Board can recommend that the Commission initiate voluntary crisis protocols for extraordinary public security or public health crises.

The Commission encourages VLOPs, VLOSEs, and other platforms/search engines to participate.

Crisis protocols may include:

Displaying authoritative crisis info (from EU/MS authorities or reliable bodies).

Designating a crisis management point of contact (could be the Art. 11 contact or Art. 41 compliance officer).

Redirecting resources to compliance with Articles 16 (notices), 20 (complaints), 22 (trusted flaggers), 23 (misuse), 35 (risk mitigation) during crises.

Protocols must clearly set:

Parameters defining the crisis & objectives.

Roles/measures of participants (before & after activation).

Activation/deactivation procedures (duration strictly limited to necessity).

Safeguards for fundamental rights (freedom of expression, non-discrimination).

A reporting process on measures, duration, and outcomes once crisis ends.

If a protocol is ineffective or lacks safeguards, the Commission can request revisions.

Context:

Designed for extraordinary circumstances (e.g., pandemics, war, terrorism).

Ensures platforms adapt quickly while protecting fundamental rights.

Builds a voluntary but structured emergency coordination tool involving platforms, Member States, and possibly civil society.

Complements the crisis response mechanism (Art. 36), but here via protocols, not binding Commission decisions.
