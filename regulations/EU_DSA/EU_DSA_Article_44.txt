Statement:

The Commission, after consulting the Board, shall support and promote voluntary standards (developed by European & international standardisation bodies) covering:

Electronic notice submissions (Art. 16).

User-friendly templates & design standards for communicating restrictions from T&Cs.

Trusted flagger notices (Art. 22), including APIs.

APIs/interfaces to support data access & scrutiny obligations (Arts. 39 & 40).

Audit standards for VLOPs/VLOSEs (Art. 37).

Ad repository interoperability (Art. 39(2)).

Data transmission standards between ad intermediaries for transparency (Art. 26(1)(b-d)).

Technical ad compliance measures, including markings for ads & commercial communications (Art. 26).

Choice interfaces for recommender systems (Arts. 27 & 38).

Standards for protecting minors online.

Commission shall support updates of these standards based on technological developments and user behaviour.

Updated information must be publicly available and accessible.

Context:

Encourages voluntary harmonisation instead of rigid regulation in technical areas.

Ensures cross-border interoperability, especially in APIs, ad transparency, recommender systems, and audit methodologies.

Provides flexibility: standards evolve with tech and behaviour.

Balances uniform EU-wide practices with international alignment (global platforms must follow same standards).
