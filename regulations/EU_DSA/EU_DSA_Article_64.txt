Statement:

The Commission, Digital Services Coordinators (DSCs), and the Board must build EU expertise and capabilities, including seconding staff from Member States.

They must coordinate the assessment of systemic and emerging issues relating to VLOPs (very large online platforms) and VLOSEs (very large online search engines).

The Commission may request support from DSCs, the Board, and other EU bodies/agencies with relevant expertise.

Member States must cooperate, making their expertise and capabilities available via their DSCs or other competent authorities.

Context:

Ensures the EU has specialised knowledge and capacity to handle digital platform risks and emerging challenges.

Builds a Union-wide monitoring and response system for systemic issues tied to the Digital Services Act (DSA).

Encourages cross-border cooperation and expertise sharing between Member States, the Commission, and EU agencies.

Supports proactive regulation by identifying trends, risks, and emerging threats before they escalate.
