Statement:

This Section applies to online platforms and search engines with ≥ 45 million average monthly active recipients in the EU (≈10% of EU population).

The Commission designates services as VLOPs/VLOSEs after consulting Member States or Digital Services Coordinators, based on:

Provider-reported data (Article 24(2)),

Requested info (Article 24(3)), or

Other available information.

Providers can submit views within 10 working days before final designation, but failure to respond does not prevent designation.

Designation ends if, for one continuous year, the service falls below the threshold.

The Commission must:

Notify providers, the Board, and the relevant Digital Services Coordinator.

Publish and maintain an official list of designated VLOPs/VLOSEs in the EU Official Journal.

Obligations apply (or end) 4 months after notification.

Threshold may be adjusted by delegated acts if EU population changes by ≥ 5% (to keep it at 10% of EU population).

Commission may also set a calculation methodology for monthly active recipients via delegated acts, considering market and tech developments.

Context:

VLOPs/VLOSEs are singled out due to their systemic impact on the digital ecosystem.

45 million users ≈ 10% of EU population (2020 baseline).

Stronger obligations aim to reduce systemic risks, ensure accountability, and safeguard EU digital safety.

Mechanism ensures flexibility: population adjustments and methodology updates can be made via delegated acts.

Public listing provides transparency and accountability.
