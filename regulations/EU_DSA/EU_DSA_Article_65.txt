Statement:

The Commission can investigate VLOPs/VLOSEs’ compliance with the DSA, using its investigatory powers even before formal proceedings.

Investigations can be started on the Commission’s initiative or following a Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) request.

If a DSC suspects systemic infringement affecting service recipients in its Member State, it may send a request to the Commission via the EU info-sharing system (Art. 85).

Such a request must be reasoned and include:

The provider’s point of contact (per Art. 11).

Description of facts, provisions breached, and justification showing the infringement is systemic.

Any additional relevant information collected, including evidence from the DSC’s own initiative.

Context:

Provides a clear escalation mechanism: local DSCs can flag systemic issues to the Commission for Union-level enforcement.

Focuses on serious or systemic infringements by VLOPs/VLOSEs (e.g., repeated breaches, large-scale user harm).

Reinforces the Commission’s role as primary enforcer for very large platforms/search engines.

Ensures cross-border issues are not handled in isolation but elevated to EU-level supervision.
