Statement:

Providers must comply with authority orders to hand over specific information about individual recipients of their service.

Providers must inform the issuing authority (or specified authority) without undue delay about receipt of the order and when it was carried out.

Orders must:

Cite the legal basis.

Identify the issuing authority.

Clearly identify the recipient(s) (e.g., account name, ID).

Explain why the information is necessary and proportionate (unless secrecy is needed for criminal cases).

State available redress mechanisms for both providers and users.

Indicate which authority receives compliance updates.

Providers may only be required to supply information they already collected and control.

Orders must be sent to the providerâ€™s electronic contact point in a declared/agreed language (translation required if not).

Digital Services Coordinators must circulate orders to other Member States through the EU system.

Providers must also inform the affected recipient, including:

Reasons for the order.

Redress options available.

National civil and criminal procedural laws remain unaffected.

Context:

Applies to judicial or administrative orders under EU/national law.

Covers situations like identifying user accounts, verifying compliance, or investigations.

Ensures balance: information can be requested, but must be targeted, lawful, and proportionate.

Reinforces cooperation across Member States via Digital Services Coordinators.
