Statement:

VLOPs and VLOSEs using recommender systems must provide at least one option per system that is not based on profiling (as defined in GDPR, Article 4(4)).

Context:

Builds on Article 27 (recommender transparency) by giving users a real choice: recommendations that donâ€™t rely on profiling (e.g., chronological feeds, non-personalised search results).

Ensures GDPR compliance by limiting profiling practices and offering alternatives that respect user privacy.

Empowers users to control their online experience, reducing algorithmic influence based on personal data.

Particularly important for systemic platforms due to their scale and impact on information access and civic discourse.
