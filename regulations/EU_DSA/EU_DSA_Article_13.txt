Statement:

Providers without an EU establishment but offering services in the EU must appoint a legal representative in one Member State where services are offered.

The representative:

Acts as the contact point for EU authorities, the Commission, and the Board.

Must have the power and resources to cooperate efficiently and comply with decisions.

Can be held liable for non-compliance, in addition to the provider itself.

Providers must notify the Digital Services Coordinator of the representativeâ€™s details (name, address, email, phone).

This information must be public, accessible, accurate, and updated.

Appointment of a representative does not count as an establishment in the EU.

Context:

Ensures that providers outside the EU remain accountable within the Union.

Legal representative serves as the official interface for regulatory and enforcement matters.

Provides authorities with a concrete, reachable contact for compliance, even if the provider is located abroad.
