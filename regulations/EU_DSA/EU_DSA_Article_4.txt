Statement:
Providers are not liable for information they transmit if:

They don’t initiate the transmission.
They don’t choose the recipient.
They don’t alter the information.

Temporary, automatic storage is allowed if it’s only for transmission purposes and lasts no longer than necessary.

Courts/authorities may still order providers to stop or prevent infringements.

Context:
Applies to “mere conduit” services → just transmitting information or giving network access (e.g., ISPs, telecom operators).
Covers technical acts like automatic, intermediate, and transient storage needed for transmission.
Liability exemption doesn’t stop Member States’ authorities from issuing blocking/removal orders.
