Statement:

VLOPs/VLOSEs must undergo an independent audit at their own expense at least once a year to assess compliance with:

Chapter III obligations (systemic risk, mitigation, transparency, etc.),

Codes of conduct (Arts. 45 & 46),

Crisis protocols (Art. 48).

Providers must fully cooperate with auditors: giving access to relevant data, premises, and responding to questions. They must not obstruct or influence audits.

Audits must ensure confidentiality of obtained info, while still enabling transparency and reporting. Public versions of reports (for Article 42 transparency) must exclude sensitive/confidential data.

Audits must be carried out by organisations that are:

Independent & conflict-free, e.g.:

No non-audit services to the provider within 12 months before/after,

No audit services for longer than 10 consecutive years,

No contingent fees.

Experts in risk management, technical competence, and compliance.

Committed to objectivity and ethics (e.g., codes of practice/standards).

Audit reports must include at minimum:

Provider & audit period details,

Auditor details,

Declaration of interests,

Elements audited & methodology,

Summary of findings,

Consulted third parties,

Audit opinion (“positive”, “positive with comments”, or “negative”),

Recommendations with timeframe (if not fully compliant).

If auditors cannot assess specific elements, they must explain why.

Providers receiving non-“positive” reports must:

Implement recommendations and file an audit implementation report within 1 month, or

Justify why they did not adopt them and describe alternative measures.

The Commission may adopt delegated acts specifying audit procedures, methodologies, and reporting templates.

Context:

Audits are a core accountability mechanism for VLOPs/VLOSEs.

Prevents self-assessment bias and ensures independent verification of compliance.

Continuous cycle: audit → recommendations → implementation report → Commission oversight.

Aligns with risk-based supervision and transparency goals of the DSA.
