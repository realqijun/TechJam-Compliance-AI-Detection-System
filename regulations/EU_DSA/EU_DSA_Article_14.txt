Statement:

Providers must clearly state in their terms and conditions (T&Cs):

Any restrictions on user-provided content.

Content moderation policies, procedures, measures, and tools (including algorithms + human review).

Rules of their internal complaint system.

T&Cs must be:

Clear, plain, user-friendly, unambiguous,

Publicly available, easily accessible, and machine-readable.

Providers must inform users of significant changes to T&Cs.

If the service is mainly directed at or used by minors, T&Cs must be explained in a way minors can understand.

Restrictions must be applied in a diligent, objective, and proportionate manner, respecting users’ fundamental rights (e.g., freedom of expression, media pluralism).

Very large platforms/search engines must:
