Statement:

Providers of intermediary services cannot be forced to:

Monitor all information they transmit or store.

Actively search for illegal activity or content.

Context:

Reinforces that providers are not general watchdogs over user activity.

Liability exemptions (Articles 4â€“7) remain intact unless providers have actual knowledge of illegal content.

Focuses obligations on specific cases (e.g., valid notices, authority orders), not blanket surveillance.
