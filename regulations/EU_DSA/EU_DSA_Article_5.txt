Statement:

Providers are not liable for automatic, intermediate, and temporary storage (“caching”) if:

They don’t modify the information.

They respect access conditions.

They follow industry-standard rules for updating information.

They don’t interfere with lawful data collection technologies.

They remove/disable stored information quickly if:

The source removes it,

Access is disabled, or

A court/authority orders removal.

Authorities may still order providers to prevent or stop infringements.

Context:

Applies to “caching services” → temporary storage done to improve efficiency or security of onward transmission.

Liability exemption applies only if providers act passively and comply with technical/industry rules.

Judicial/administrative authorities retain power to issue blocking/removal orders.
