Statement:

In a crisis situation (serious threat to public security or public health in the EU), the Commission, acting on the Boardâ€™s recommendation, may order VLOPs/VLOSEs to:

Assess how their services contribute to the threat.

Identify and apply effective, proportionate measures (e.g., mitigation steps under Articles 35 & 48).

Report to the Commission (by a set deadline or regularly) on risk assessments, measures taken, their impact, and related issues.

Measures must consider urgency, seriousness of the threat, and fundamental rights under the Charter.

Commission decisions must be:

Necessary, justified, and proportionate,

Limited to max 3 months,

With clear deadlines for providers to act.

After adoption, the Commission must:

Notify providers,

Make the decision public,

Inform and consult the Board.

Providers retain discretion to choose the specific measures but must ensure they are effective and proportionate.

Commission monitors compliance via reports and other data; if measures are ineffective, it may require providers to review them.

Decisions may later be amended to:

Revoke measures (if threat no longer exists),

Extend them (max 3 months more),

Adjust them for fundamental rights concerns.

Commission must report:

Regularly to the Board (monthly at least),

Annually to Parliament & Council,

And within 3 months after a crisis ends.

Context:

Provides a temporary emergency tool for the EU to address crises (e.g., pandemics, wars, disinformation threats).

Balances swift intervention with safeguards for fundamental rights and proportionality.

Ensures transparency (public publication + reporting) and oversight by both the Board and EU political institutions.

Specific measures are chosen by providers, but under strict Commission oversight.
