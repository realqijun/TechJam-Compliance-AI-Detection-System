Statement:

VLOPs/VLOSEs must pay an annual supervisory fee to the Commission once designated under Article 33.

Fee covers costs of Commission’s supervisory tasks (designation, database management, info-sharing systems, referrals, Board support, audits, etc.).

Fee is charged per service designated as a VLOP/VLOSE.

Limits and principles:

Fee must reflect actual supervisory costs.

Amount is proportionate to average monthly active recipients in the EU.

Fee cannot exceed 0.05% of provider’s worldwide net income from the previous financial year.

Process:

Commission sets fee amounts via implementing acts, following methodology in delegated acts.

Delegated acts define methodology for: cost estimation, individual fee calculation, max limit, and payment arrangements.

Revenue use:

Supervisory fees count as external assigned revenue under EU budget law.

Accountability:

Commission must report annually to Parliament & Council on supervisory costs and fees collected.

Context:

Ensures cost recovery for EU oversight of systemic platforms.

Prevents overcharging by capping fees relative to global net income.

Introduces a transparent methodology, with annual reporting for accountability.

Aligns with the principle that biggest platforms (who create highest systemic risks) bear the cost of regulation.
