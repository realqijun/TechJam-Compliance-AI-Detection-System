Statement:

Online platforms must provide users (and notifiers) with free electronic access to an internal complaint-handling system for at least six months after a decision.

Users can complain about platform decisions concerning:

Removal, disabling, or visibility restriction of content.

Suspension/termination of services (fully or partly).

Suspension/termination of user accounts.

Suspension, termination, or restriction of monetisation.

Complaint systems must be:

Easy to access, user-friendly, precise, and allow substantiated complaints.

Complaints must be handled:

Timely, non-discriminatorily, diligently, and objectively.

If a complaint shows the decision was wrong, the platform must reverse it without undue delay.

Platforms must inform complainants of:

Their reasoned decision,

Options for out-of-court dispute settlement (Article 21), and

Other redress options.

Decisions must be supervised by qualified staff â€” not based solely on automated tools.

Context:

Period of 6 months starts when the user is first informed of the decision (per Articles 16(5) & 17).

Reinforces fairness and accountability in moderation decisions.

Protects users from arbitrary or automated-only moderation by requiring human oversight.

Connects directly to the redress mechanisms in Article 21.
