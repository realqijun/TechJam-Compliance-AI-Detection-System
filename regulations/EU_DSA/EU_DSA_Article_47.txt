Statement:

The Commission promotes voluntary EU-level accessibility codes of conduct with involvement from:

Online platforms & service providers,

Organisations representing users (including persons with disabilities),

Civil society & relevant authorities.

Goal: ensure full, equal participation of persons with disabilities by improving access to online services through design & adaptation.

Codes must aim at:

Accessible design/adaptation – services must be perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

Transparency on accessibility – providers explain how they meet accessibility requirements and make this info publicly accessible in a disability-friendly format.

Accessible compliance info – information, forms, and measures under the DSA must be easy to find, easy to understand, and accessible to persons with disabilities.

Timeline:

Codes developed by 18 Feb 2025.

Applied by 18 Aug 2025.

Context:
