Hosting providers must give a clear, specific statement of reasons to affected users whenever they restrict content or accounts because it is illegal or against their terms.

Applies to restrictions such as:

Removal, disabling access, demotion, or other visibility limits.

Suspension/termination of payments.

Suspension/termination of service (partially or fully).

Suspension/termination of a user account.

The statement must include:

Type of restriction (e.g., removal, suspension) + scope + duration.

Facts and circumstances for the decision (including whether it was based on a notice under Article 16 or provider’s own checks; notifier’s identity only if strictly necessary).

Whether automated tools were used.

Legal grounds (for illegal content cases).

Contractual grounds (for T&C violations).

Information on available redress mechanisms (complaints, out-of-court settlement, judicial review).

Statements must be clear, specific, and comprehensible, allowing users to properly exercise redress rights.

Context:

Obligation applies only if the provider knows the user’s contact details.

Must be provided at the time of restriction or earlier.

Exemption: does not apply to deceptive, high-volume commercial spam.
