Statement:

Users (including notifiers) may choose a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body to challenge platform decisions listed in Article 20.

Platforms must make this option clearly visible and accessible on their interface.

Users retain the right to go to court at any time.

Both parties must engage in good faith; platforms may refuse if the same issue was already resolved.

Settlement bodies cannot impose binding decisions.

Certification (by Digital Services Coordinators) is valid for 5 years and renewable, provided the body is:

Impartial and independent (financially too).

Expert in illegal content or platform T&Cs.

Fairly remunerated (not outcome-linked).

Accessible online, with electronic submission of documents.

Swift, efficient, low-cost, and available in at least one EU official language.

Operating with clear, fair, and public procedures.

Certified bodies must:

Publish decisions within 90 days (max 180 days for complex cases).

Report annually to their certifying Coordinator (number of disputes, outcomes, avg. time, difficulties).

Fees: if user wins, platform pays all costs + reimburses userâ€™s expenses. If platform wins, user pays nothing (unless acting in bad faith). For users, access must be free or nominal cost.

Member States may establish or support certified bodies, but certification must remain independent.

Certification may be revoked if conditions are no longer met.

The Commission maintains a public EU-wide list of certified bodies.

Context:

Strengthens redress rights for users against platforms outside courts.

Ensures settlements are voluntary, impartial, and accessible.

Fees are capped and transparency about them is mandatory.

Links with Directive 2013/11/EU (consumer ADR) but tailored for online platform disputes.

Certification and oversight handled by Digital Services Coordinators, ensuring cross-border recognition.
