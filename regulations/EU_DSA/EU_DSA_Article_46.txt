Statement:

The Commission promotes voluntary EU-level codes of conduct for online advertising.

Participants: online platforms, advertising intermediaries, programmatic ad actors, civil society, user orgs, and authorities.

Goal: enhance transparency across the ad value chain, beyond the minimum rules of Articles 26 & 39.

Codes should ensure competitive, transparent, and fair advertising while respecting competition, privacy, and data protection law.

Must cover at least:

(a) Sharing of ad-related information by intermediaries with users (per Art. 26(1)(bâ€“d)).

(b) Transmission of information to ad repositories (per Art. 39).

(c) Clear information on data monetisation practices.

Timeline:

Codes developed by 18 Feb 2025.

Applied by 18 Aug 2025.

Commission will encourage broad endorsement & compliance by all actors in the ad value chain.

Context:

Aims to close gaps in ad transparency not fully covered by binding provisions.

Provides soft law framework to align stakeholders and foster cooperation.

Ensures users understand who paid for ads, how targeting works, and how data monetisation occurs.

Creates a clearer, fairer online ad ecosystem through voluntary but structured commitments.
