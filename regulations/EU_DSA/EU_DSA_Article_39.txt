Statement:

VLOPs and VLOSEs presenting ads must maintain a publicly accessible ad repository that is:

Searchable, reliable, supports multi-criteria queries, and available via APIs.

Contains ad information for the full display period + 1 year after the ad last appeared.

Must not contain personal data of ad recipients, and providers must ensure accuracy and completeness.

Repository must include at least:

Content of the ad (product, service, brand, subject).

Advertiser (on whose behalf the ad is shown).

Payer (if different from advertiser).

Ad run period.

Targeting information (main parameters for inclusion/exclusion of groups).

Declared commercial communications (per Article 26(2)).

Reach data: total number of recipients, with Member State breakdown if targeted.

If an ad is removed/disabled for illegality or terms violation, the repository must instead include:

A transparency record (Article 17(3)(a)â€“(e) or Article 9(2)(a)(i), as applicable), not the original ad content or advertiser details.

The Commission may issue guidelines (after consulting the Board, vetted researchers, and the public) on repository structure, organisation, and functionality.

Context:

Strengthens baseline ad transparency rules (Article 26) with systemic obligations for VLOPs/VLOSEs.

Ensures public, researchers, and regulators can scrutinise online ads, their targeting, funding, and reach.

Addresses risks of manipulative or hidden political/issue-based ads by requiring structured, queryable, and long-term accessible data.

Helps monitor compliance with illegal content and disinformation rules.
