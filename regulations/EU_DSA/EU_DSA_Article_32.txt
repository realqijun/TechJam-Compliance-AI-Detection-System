Statement:

If a platform enabling consumer-trader distance contracts becomes aware that an illegal product or service was offered through its service, it must:

Inform affected consumers (where contact details are available) that:

The product/service is illegal,

The trader’s identity,

Available redress options.

Obligation applies only to purchases made within the last 6 months before the platform became aware.

If the platform does not have consumer contact details, it must instead publish the information publicly and accessibly on its interface.

Context:

Strengthens consumer protection and transparency by ensuring buyers are informed if they purchased something illegal.

Balances obligation with feasibility — applies only within 6 months and only if contact details are available.

Public disclosure ensures wider consumer awareness when direct communication isn’t possible.

Complements Article 30 (traceability of traders) and Article 31 (compliance by design) by closing the loop when illegality is detected post-sale.
