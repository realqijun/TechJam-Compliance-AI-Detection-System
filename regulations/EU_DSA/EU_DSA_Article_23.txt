Statement:

Online platforms must suspend services (for a reasonable period, after warning) to:

Users who frequently provide manifestly illegal content.

Individuals/entities who frequently submit manifestly unfounded notices or complaints.

Suspensions must be decided case by case, based on:

Number of illegal/unfounded submissions,

Proportion relative to total submissions,

Gravity of the misuse and its consequences,

Intention of the user/notifier (where identifiable).

Platforms must publish in their terms and conditions:

Their misuse policy,

Examples of misuse,

Suspension durations.

Context:

Balances user rights with platform protection against abuse of systems.

Misuse includes both:

Uploading illegal content,

Misusing notice-and-action or complaint mechanisms.

Safeguards require fair assessment: suspensions must be objective, diligent, and not arbitrary.

Transparency through T&Cs ensures predictability and deterrence.
