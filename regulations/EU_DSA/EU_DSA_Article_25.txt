Statement:

Platforms must not design or operate their interfaces in ways that:

Deceive or manipulate users, or

Distort/impair usersâ€™ ability to make free and informed decisions.

Examples of prohibited practices may include:

Giving undue prominence to certain choices when asking for consent.

Repeatedly pushing users to make the same choice (e.g., intrusive pop-ups).

The Commission may issue guidelines clarifying applications of this rule.

Does not override existing rules already covered under:

Directive 2005/29/EC (Unfair Commercial Practices Directive).
