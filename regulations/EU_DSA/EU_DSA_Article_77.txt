Statement:

The Commission has a five-year limitation period to impose penalties, which can be interrupted and reset by certain actions related to the investigation or proceedings.

Context:

Limitation period: The Commission has five years to impose fines or penalty payments, starting from the day the infringement occurs. For ongoing or repeated infringements, the period starts when the infringement ceases.

Interruption of limitation: Actions such as requests for information, inspections, or opening proceedings interrupt the limitation period, resetting the clock.

Double limitation period: The limitation period can be extended, but will expire at the latest after twice the initial period without penalties being imposed.

Suspension: The limitation period is suspended if the Commission's decision is being reviewed by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
