Statement:

Providers must comply with authority orders to remove or disable access to specific illegal content.

Providers must inform the issuing authority (or designated authority) without undue delay about how and when the order was carried out.

Orders must:

Cite the legal basis.

Explain why the content is illegal.

Identify the issuing authority.

Provide clear details to locate content (e.g., exact URLs).

Inform both provider and user about redress options.

Specify the authority to receive compliance information.

Orders must be territorially limited (only as far as needed to meet the objective).

Orders must be sent to the providerâ€™s electronic point of contact in a declared/agreed language, or accompanied by a translation of key elements.

Providers must inform the affected user about:

The order received.

The reasons.

The territorial scope.

Available redress.

Digital Services Coordinators must share orders across Member States via the EU system.

Context:

Applies to judicial or administrative orders issued under EU or national law (aligned with Union law).

National civil and criminal procedural law remains unaffected.

Reinforces cross-border cooperation through Digital Services Coordinators (DSCs).
