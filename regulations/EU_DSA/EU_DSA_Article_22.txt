Statement:

Online platforms must give priority processing (fast, reliable handling) to notices submitted by trusted flaggers within their expertise.

Trusted flagger status is awarded by the Digital Services Coordinator if the applicant:

Has proven expertise in detecting/identifying illegal content.

Is independent of online platforms.

Acts diligently, accurately, and objectively.

Trusted flaggers must publish annual reports showing:

Number of notices submitted,

Hosting providers concerned,

Types of illegal content notified,

Actions taken by providers.

Explanation of safeguards ensuring independence.

Reports must be sent to the awarding Coordinator and made public (no personal data).

Digital Services Coordinators must notify the Commission and the Board of all trusted flaggers awarded, suspended, or revoked.

The Commission maintains a public EU database of trusted flaggers (updated, machine-readable).

If a trusted flagger submits many poor-quality notices, platforms must inform the Coordinator with evidence â†’ Coordinator can suspend status during investigation.

Coordinator may revoke status if conditions are no longer met, after giving the entity a chance to respond.

The Commission may issue guidelines to help with consistent application.

Context:

Trusted flaggers are specialised, reliable notifiers with priority in content moderation systems.

Designed to improve efficiency of handling illegal content while avoiding abuse of the status.

Safeguards ensure independence, transparency, and accountability.

Oversight is shared between Digital Services Coordinators (award/revoke status) and the Commission (maintains EU-wide registry).
